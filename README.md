Building projects the make a difference from the UI to the pixel-perfect code

#### Motivation

For some time, I was looking for a project in which I could show my potential as a design engineer, working from research, creating the interface as a designer to deployment as a software engineer, however, I also didn't want to create something full of effects or features, I wanted something that was simple, functional, organized and useful.

### Technologies

- *:fire: Vitest - Software Quality*
- *:fire: Cypress - Software Quality*
- *:fire: Sentry - Error monitoring*

### Important technical points

- *:gear: All featured projects was statically generated to improve detail page*
- *:gear: Projects that are not featured are dynamically generated because they do not have much access as those that are featured*
- *:gear: When you are waiting for a dinamically page, a skeleton is displayed to improve the user experience*
- *:gear: All component that use client resources have been componentized to optimize the usage of server components*

### Installing

  git clone https://github.com/avilyre/avilysilva
```
```javascript
  // Install all dependencies with pnpm or your favorite package manager

:warning: Now you have to setup the environment variables. You can find an example file in the project root
```javascript
  // That is it, run the project
  pnpm run dev
```
You can view the project at the address displayed in the terminal

### Testing
Cypress was used for testing and it's simple to run it
```javascript
  // Running application's tests
  pnpm run cypress:test
  // or
  // Running cypress's ui testing
  pnpm run cypress:open
```
